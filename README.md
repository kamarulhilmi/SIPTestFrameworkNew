# SIPTestFrameworkNew

I build this test framework for the purpose to automate all the test execution for SIP system for ATMS project. The script I write is using C# programming language that communicate with the test framework that I build by uilising Selenium web driver API. The framework will communicate directly the browser to execute the automation test script.
